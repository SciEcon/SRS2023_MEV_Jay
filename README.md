# Machine Learning in MEV Detection
## Project information
- **Author**: Jiayi Wang, Applied Mathematics, Class of 2024, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Prof. Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: Submissions to the SRS2023 Innovate instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Acknowledgments**: I am deeply indebted to my professor Luyao Zhang for her invaluable patience and feedback. I could not started my journey without her instructions and help. Additionally, this endeavour would not have been possible without Flashbots. Lastly, I would be remiss in not mentioning my family, especially my parents.
- **Project Summary**: 
Miner Extractable Value (MEV) has garnered significant attention from researchers due to its implications for the security and privacy of blockchain networks. The current cryptocurrency market has difficulty solving and detecting the MEV in a timely manner, and the problem has become one of the biggest issues on Ethereum. According to Flashbots[1], MEV has extracted over $600 million in only two years, and the number is continuously increasing. Machine Learning has provided us with a method to identify the MEV in time. However, collecting a comprehensive dataset of labelled examples for different MEV strategies can be difficult, limiting the accuracy and generalizability of the models. Meanwhile, MEV strategies can evolve and adapt over time to avoid detection. Machine learning models need to continually update and adapt to new MEV techniques to remain effective. Adversarial strategies can also be employed to deliberately bypass detection methods, requiring constant vigilance and model refinement. The whole detection process requires several steps to complete. This project is meant to retrieve transaction data.
